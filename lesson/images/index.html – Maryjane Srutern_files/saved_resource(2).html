            <p>This type of shawarma is my signature recipes that is known by all my friends because I make this so often.but now i will be making it for public consumption It’s <strong>off the charts for effort vs output</strong>: just a handful of everyday spices, a splash of lemon, garlic and olive oil transforms into the most incredible flavour.</p>

            <p><strong>When this chicken is cooking, the smell is <i>incredible</i></strong>. Incredible!!!

            <h2>How to Serve Chicken Shawarma</h2>
            <p>There are two main ways to serve Chicken Shawarma.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>As Chicken Shawarma wraps – with tomato, lettuce, and a simple yoghurt sauce on the side.</li>
                <li>nd the other way is with rice and salads on the side. Thought I usually do serve pita bread or another type of <a href="https://www.recipetineats.com/easy-soft-flatbread-yeast/">flatbread</a> as well, just because it’s very on theme.</li>
            </ol>
